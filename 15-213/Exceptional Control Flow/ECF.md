### Altering the Control Flow
* Jump and branches
* Call and return
Change **program state.**
**But insufficient for a useful system. Difficult to react to changes in system state.**

So, system needs mechanisms for **ECF**

# Exceptions
An exception is a **transfer of control to the OS kernel** in response to some **event** (i.e., change in processor state)
