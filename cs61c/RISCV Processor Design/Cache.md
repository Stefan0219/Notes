# Memory Hierarchy Basis
* Temporal locality: If we use it now, chances are we'll want to use it again soon.
> Keep most recently accessed data items closer to the processor.
* Spatial locality: If we use a piece of memory, chances are we'll use the neighboring pieces soon.
> Move blocks consisting of contiguous words closer to the processor.
# Cache
**Caches provide an illusion to the processor that the memory is infinitely large and infinitely fast**
## Direct Mapped Caches
**In a direct-mapped cache, each memory address is associated with one possible block within the cache**
